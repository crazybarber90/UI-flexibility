# Overview:

Digital Agency UI: 4 pages — TailwindCSS / Styled Components / Vanilla CSS + Axios (dynamic cards).

This project showcases a modern digital agency interface inspired by creative tech branding and onboarding UI references.
The goal was to explore different styling approaches within one React app to demonstrate adaptability and clean design principles.

Visual inspiration:
[Envato Elements — Advertising Agency Website](https://elements.envato.com/advertising-agency-website-SM84RT3)

# IMPORTANT

I did not try to break the code into the smallest components and do everything through props, but to demonstrate several ways of styling a web application

# How to run:

npm install && npm run dev

# CSS Flexibility:

pages/Home (Tailwind).
pages/About (Styled Components),
pages/Services (Axios),
pages/Contact (Vanilla CSS),

I used existing onboarding visual language as reference and implemented 3 different styling approaches to show different css flexibility

# Notes

The design is inspired by the Envato template above, but simplified and adapted to my own structure.

Also I intentionally mixed three different CSS approaches to demonstrate flexibility in styling strategies across pages.

Focused on component modularity, readability, and consistent color/font system.
